.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmpolld is polling daemon for LVM. The daemon receives requests for polling
of already initialised operations originating in LVM2 command line tool.
The requests for polling originates in \fBlvconvert\fP, \fBpvmove\fP,
\fBlvchange\fP or \fBvgchange\fP LVM2 command.

The purpose of lvmpolld is to eliminate the posibility of spawning redundant
background processes per otherwise unique polling operation. It also eliminates the
possibility of unsolicited background process termination by external factors.

lvmpolld is used by LVM only if it is enabled in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) by specifying the
\fBglobal/use_lvmpolld\fP setting. If this is not defined in the LVM configuration
explicitly then default setting is used instead (see the output of
\fBlvm dumpconfig \-\-type default global/use_lvmpolld\fP command).
.SH OPTIONS

To run the daemon in a test environment both the pidfile_path and the
socket_path should be changed from the defaults.
.TP
.B \-f
Don't fork, but run in the foreground.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-?
Show help information.
.TP
.IR \fB\-l " {" all | wire | debug }
Select the type of log messages to generate.
Messages are logged by syslog.  
Additionally, when \-f is given they are also sent to standard error.
There are two classes of messages: wire and debug. Selecting 'all' supplies both
and is equivalent to a comma-separated list \-l wire,debug.
.TP
.B \-p \fIpidfile_path
Path to the pidfile. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_PID_DIR#/lvmpolld.pid) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE\fP.  This file is used to prevent more
than one instance of the daemon running simultaneously.
.TP
.B \-s \fIsocket_path
Path to the socket file. This overrides both the built-in default
(#DEFAULT_RUN_DIR#/lvmpolld.socket) and the environment variable
\fBLVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET\fP.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout_value
.TP
.B \-B \fIlvm_binary_path
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version of lvmpolld daemon.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_PIDFILE
Path for the pid file.
.TP
.B LVM_LVMPOLLD_SOCKET 
Path for the socket file.
